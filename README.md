# Traffic-Citation-Phoenix
# Traffic Citation Analysis Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled **Traffic Citation Analysis**, created as a collaborative project by Group 3. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and potential disparities in traffic citation issuance in Phoenix, leveraging a structured approach that includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Problem Statement**: Explores key research questions regarding traffic citation patterns and potential demographic disparities.
- **Pseudocode-Driven Approach**: Detailed pseudocode outlining each step of the analysis pipeline.
- **Collaborative Effort**: Documents individual contributions from team members.

## Content Overview

### 1. Problem Statement
The project aims to investigate trends and disparities in traffic citations by analyzing:
- The relationship between individual demographics (sex, race, age, ethnicity) and citation likelihood.
- Citation frequency based on time of day, month, or year.
- Long-term trends in traffic citations and their correlation with officer demographics.
The study uses datasets containing traffic citation data and officer demographic details.

### 2. Pseudocode
The notebook includes detailed pseudocode outlining:
1. Data loading and initial exploration.
2. Data cleaning (e.g., mapping months and days, handling missing values).
3. Monthly and yearly trends analysis.
4. Cross-analysis of citations and officer demographic data.
5. Visualization and interpretation of results.

### 3. Python Code
The notebook implements Python-based data analysis techniques using libraries such as:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations.
- **NumPy** for numerical operations.

### 4. Team Contributions
The notebook provides a section detailing each team memberâ€™s role and contribution, ensuring transparency and equitable credit.

### 5. Results Interpretation
The project emphasizes deriving actionable insights to inform law enforcement policies and address any disparities in traffic enforcement practices.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or a compatible environment.
3. Follow the pseudocode and run the code cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Key Insights
The notebook delivers:
- Detailed trend analyses of traffic citations over time.
- Insights into potential biases in citation issuance based on officer and individual demographics.

## Acknowledgments
The dataset used in this project includes traffic citation records and officer demographics from the city of Phoenix. All data cleaning and analysis were carried out collaboratively by Group 3.
